Here's a revised version of the **README.md** that clearly states that you have developed only the backend part of the Online Quiz System:

```markdown
# Online Quiz System (Backend)

This project includes the **backend** of an Online Quiz System, developed using Spring Boot. The backend handles user authentication, quiz management, and result processing. It provides RESTful APIs for managing quizzes and user data, intended to be consumed by a frontend interface.

**Note:** This repository currently contains only the backend part of the application.

## Features
- RESTful API for managing quizzes and users
- User authentication and authorization (login, registration)
- CRUD operations for quizzes and questions
- Quiz submission and result calculation
- JSON-based API responses

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java
- **Database**: MySQL / SQLite
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JellaSindhu/Online-Quiz-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Online-Quiz-System
   ```
3. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
4. Configure the database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties` by updating the following:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
5. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
2. The backend APIs will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints
- **User Authentication:**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and generate a token
- **Quiz Management:**
  - `GET /api/quizzes`: Get all quizzes
  - `POST /api/quizzes`: Create a new quiz
  - `GET /api/quizzes/{id}`: Get a specific quiz by ID
  - `PUT /api/quizzes/{id}`: Update a quiz
  - `DELETE /api/quizzes/{id}`: Delete a quiz
- **Quiz Submission:**
  - `POST /api/quizzes/{id}/submit`: Submit a quiz and get results
